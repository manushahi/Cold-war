  <p class="vm6">The French could no longer control Vietnam so Ho Chi Minh of North Vietnam decided to form a communist country.  It is believed the US president didn’t wish to offend France by normalizing relations with Ho, so he began a campaign of terrorism against the south. It had always been his dream to reunite Vietnam into one country.  Free elections had been promised and agreed to but they didn’t happen.  Ho pressed for action against the south to force them into joining the north.  Viet Cong troops used threats against innocent civilians.  When it became obvious the Chinese were assisting Ho, the government of the south asked the Allied countries for assistance.  The allies agreed because they wanted to get rid of all communism.  However, because the U.S. was fighting against the communist North Vietnamese, the Soviets decided to back up the communists.  This way the soviets weren’t directly fighting the U.S. but instead were using a proxy war.  The fighting escalated until in 1968 there were about 550,000 Allied troops there assisting the south.  The U.S. made very little progress in Vietnam because they couldn’t seem to adapt to the Viet Cong’s fighting style.  In 1968 the Viet Cong assassinated about 3,000 civilians during the Tet offensive which was supposed to be a cease fire.  The communists ignored their promise and attacked numerous cities in the south.  Eventually, the cost and the death toll turned Americans totally against the war and on April 30, 1975 the last American troops left Vietnam by helicopter as the soldiers of the communist soldiers of the north marched into Saigon.  This war was key to the idea of cold war because the U.S. and Soviets helped the opposing sides but didn’t have to wage hot war on each other.  They were always looking for ways to indirectly fight each other and this was one of the best examples.</p>
