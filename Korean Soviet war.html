Korea was occupied by Japan until the end of WWII. After the end of WWII, Korea was divided by the U.S. to the south and Russia/China to the North similar to what happened in Germany. The two countries were divided at the 38th parallel.  This was to ensure a buffer zone between the two super powers. On June 25, 1950, the North invaded the south pushing all the way to the tip of the peninsula in a matter of months.  The U.S. soon intervened by landing in Incheon, not too far south of the 38th parallel.  With the help of the U.S., the South pushed back up to the Chinese border.  The Chinese then fought back and pushed back down to the 38th parallel.  The rest of the war was fought along this line where an armistice was signed in 1953.  The war was started at the 38th parallel and ended at the 38th parallel.  This war is one of the most important even though it is often forgotten.  This is where the U.S. wins its first battle of containment against the Soviet Union.  This was the U.S.’s first chance to fight communism backed by the Soviets without starting a nuclear war.  The U.S. had to show that they weren’t going to let the Soviets advance and they held them to the 38th so they did their job.  It was a great victory for the U.S.</p>
<h2 class="kw4">The Korean War and the Cold War</h2>
<p class="kw3">Even so, the North Korean invasion came as an alarming surprise to American officials. As far as they were concerned, this was not simply a border dispute between two unstable dictatorships on the other side of the globe. Instead, many feared it was the first step in a communist campaign to take over the world. For this reason, nonintervention was not considered an option by many top decision makers. (In fact, in April 1950, a National Security Council report known as NSC-68 had recommended that the United States use military force to “contain” communist expansionism anywhere it seemed to be occurring, “regardless of the intrinsic strategic or economic value of the lands in question.”)

“If we let Korea down,” President Harry Truman (1884-1972) said, “the Soviet[s] will keep right on going and swallow up one [place] after another.” The fight on the Korean peninsula was a symbol of the global struggle between east and west, good and evil. As the North Korean army pushed into Seoul, the South Korean capital, the United States readied its troops for a war against communism itself.</p>
