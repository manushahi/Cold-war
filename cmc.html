  <p>On October 14, 1962, a U-2 spy plane flying over Cuba discovered nuclear missile sites under construction.  These missiles would have been capable of quickly reaching the United States.  President Kennedy convened a small group of senior officials to debate the crisis.  This group was known as ExComm and they met almost continuously for the next two weeks.  The group was split between those who wanted a military solution, such as an invasion or air strikes, and those who wanted a diplomatic solution to remove the missiles.  Eight days later, Kennedy ordered a naval blockade of Cuba and all U.S. military forces to DEFCON 3.  DEFCON 3 is an increased readiness in force greater than that required for normal readiness.  ICBMs were prepared for launch, Polaris submarines were dispatched, and B-52 bombers were placed on alert.  The world watched as tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union increased. Khrushchev put Warsaw Pact forces on alert. Later, U.S. forces were placed on DEFCON 2 (next step to nuclear war).  Reconnaissance flights by U-2s continued over Cuba, while U.S. and Soviet officials exchanged words of warning.  Finally on October 28, Khrushchev announced that they were withdrawing the missiles from Cuba.  In the spring of 1963, the U.S. quietly removed the missiles from Turkey that equally threatened the Soviet Union.  This crisis is regarded as the closest the world has come to a nuclear exchange.  Soon after this incident, the famous "hotline" was installed between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to help resolve future conflicts.  It was later learned that the missiles on Cuba were operational and were armed with nuclear warheads.  This event was one of the most important to the cold war because it was the closest the U.S. and Soviets ever came to hot war or direct combat.  Both countries had enough nuclear power to do a whole lot of damage.  The whole world waited in fear as these tensions became as high as ever.  This wouldâ€™ve become the most damaging hot wars the world ever saw so that is why it is extremely important to understanding the cold war.

  <!-- <p>espite the enormous tension, Soviet and American leaders found a way out of the impasse. During the crisis, the Americans and Soviets had exchanged letters and other communications, and on October 26, Khrushchev sent a message to Kennedy in which he offered to remove the Cuban missiles in exchange for a promise by U.S. leaders not to invade Cuba. The following day, the Soviet leader sent a letter proposing that the USSR would dismantle its missiles in Cuba if the Americans removed their missile installations in Turkey.</p> -->
