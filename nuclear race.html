  <h1 class="nr1">Warhead Development</h1>
  <p class="nr2">In the years immediately after the Second World War, the United States had a monopoly on specific knowledge of and raw materials for nuclear weaponry. American leaders hoped that their exclusive ownership of nuclear weapons would be enough to draw concessions from the Soviet Union but this proved ineffective.Just six months after the UN General Assembly, the United States conducted its first post-war nuclear tests. This was called Operation Crossroads.[10] The purpose of this operation was to test the effectiveness of nuclear explosions on ships. These tests were performed at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on 95 ships, including German and Japanese ships that were captured during World War II. One plutonium implosion-type bomb was detonated over the fleet, while the other one was detonated underwater.

<h2 class="nr3">Arms Race</h2>
<p class="nr2">With both sides in the "cold war" having nuclear capability, an arms race developed, with the Soviet Union attempting first to catch up and then to surpass the Americans.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned about a risk of nuclear war, as the negative dynamics was quite noticeable in 2018. He urged the nuclear states to build channels on forestalling potential incidents, in order to lower the risks.

<h2 class="nr3">Delivery Vehicles</h2>
<p class="nr2">Missiles had long been regarded the ideal platform for nuclear weapons, and were potentially a more effective delivery system than bombers. Starting in the 1950s, medium-range ballistic missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles ("IRBM"s) were developed for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons, and the technology developed to the progressively longer ranges, eventually becoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union showed the world that they had missiles able to reach any part of the world when they launched the Sputnik satellite into Earth orbit. The United States launched its first satellite Explorer 1 on January 31, 1958.</p>

<h2 class="nr3">Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD)</h2>
<p class="nr2">By the mid-1960s both the United States and the Soviet Union had enough nuclear power to obliterate[clarification needed] the other side. Both sides developed a capability to launch a devastating attack even after sustaining a full assault from the other side (especially by means of submarines), called a second strike.[19] This policy became known as Mutual Assured Destruction: both sides knew that any attack upon the other would be devastating to themselves, thus in theory restraining them from attacking the other.</p>
