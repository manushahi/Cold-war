  <h2 class="event3">1.Berlin Airlift</h2>
  <p class="event4">
In June 1948 the U.S. and Britain announced a proposal for establishing a new currency, the Deutschmark, into West Berlin. This immediately caused economic chaos in the Soviet Union as people frantically struggled to adjust to the new system of currency.  The Soviets responded on June 24 by cutting off all road, rail and canal links between West Germany and West Berlin. This was the start of the Berlin Blockade.  Stalin was attempting to get western influence out of his West Berlin.  He managed to cut off all of the land and water routes however the air was still available.  This began the Berlin Air Lift.  During the eleven months of the Berlin Airlift, U.S. and British planes supplied West Berlin with 1.5 million tons of supplies, a plane landing every three minutes, day and night.  The U.S. and British gave the people of West Berlin food, medical supplies and all sorts of other goods.  In the eyes of the rest of the world this made the U.S. look like heroes.  It made Stalin look like a terrible leader.  On May 12, 1949, Stalin, knowing he couldn’t risk shooting down the planes and realizing the PR disaster he’d caused, lifted the blockade.  The whole experience was very embarrassing for the Soviet Union and was considered a win for the U.S. and its allies.  This was very important to the Cold War because in a cold war where there is no direct fighting, it is things like this that decide who wins and who loses.  This was a huge win for the U.S. and put many countries on our side.</p>

  <h2 class="event3">U-2 Incident</h2>
  <p class="event4">
The U-2 Incident was one instance where the Soviets shot directly at a U.S. soldier.   On May 1, 1960, the Soviet Union shot down a U.S. U-2 reconnaissance plane and called the flight an aggressive act.  The U.S. denied Soviet claims that the pilot, F. Gary Powers, had stated that his mission was to collect Soviet intelligence data.  Khrushchev, the Soviet leader at this time, declared that the Soviet Union would not take part in a scheduled summit conference with the U.S., Britain, and France unless the U.S. immediately stopped flights over Soviet territory, apologized, and punished those responsible.</p>

  <h2 class="event3">Sputnik Crisis</h2>
  <p class="event4">The Sputnik crisis was the American reaction to the success of the Sputnik program.  It was a key Cold War event that began on October 4, 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite.  The launch of Sputnik I rattled the American public.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower referred to it as the “Sputnik Crisis”.  Although Sputnik was itself harmless, its orbiting intensified the continual threat the United States watched for from the Soviet Union The same rocket that launched Sputnik could send a nuclear warhead anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes, crossing the oceans that had successfully protected the continental United States from attack during both World Wars</p>

  <h2 class="event3">Perestroika Glasnost</h2>
  <p class="event4">
When Mikhail S. Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985, he launched his nation on a dramatic new course.  His dual program of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness) introduced huge changes in economic practice, internal affairs and international relations.  Within five years, Gorbachev's revolutionary program swept communist governments throughout Eastern Europe from power and brought an end to the Cold War (1945-91).  The largely political and economic rivalry between the Soviets and the United States and their respective allies that emerged following World War II was over.  Gorbachev's actions also set the stage for the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which dissolved into 15 individual republics.  He resigned from office on December 25, 1991.</p>
