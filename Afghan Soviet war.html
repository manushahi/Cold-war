  <h2></h2>
  <p class="asw2">
The Soviet war in Afghanistan lasted nine years from December 1979 to February 1989.  It was fought between Soviet-led Afghan forces against multi-national rebel groups called the mujahideens.  The Soviets led the Afghans because they were communist and had good resources.  The rebels were backed by the U.S. to combat the Soviets without having to declare war on them.  The rebels received military training in neighboring Pakistan, China, and received billions of dollars from the U.S., United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and other countries.  The decade long war resulted in millions of Afghans fleeing their country, mostly to Pakistan and Iran.  Hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians were killed in addition to the participants in the war.  The initial Soviet deployment of the 40th Army in Afghanistan began on December 24, 1979 under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.  The final troop withdrawal started on May 15, 1988, and ended on February 15, 1989 under the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.  This like the Vietnam war is another example of a proxy war.  These are important to the Cold War because that is how the U.S. and Soviets clash.</p>
